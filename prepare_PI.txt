Preparing Raspberry Pi 5 for Arduino Connection

1. Install required Python packages:
   Once your Raspberry Pi is booted up, open a terminal and run these commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip python3-matplotlib
   pip3 install pyserial numpy
   ```

2. Transfer the Python script:
   - Copy the Python script to your Raspberry Pi
   - Save it as `water_sensor_monitor.py`

3. Make the script executable:
```bash 
   chmod +x water_sensor_monitor.py
```
4. Connect Arduino to Raspberry Pi:
   - Connect the Arduino UNO to any USB port on the Raspberry Pi
   - The Arduino should be powered by the USB connection

5. Identify the correct serial port:
```bash

   ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
   
```
   - For Arduino UNO, it's typically `/dev/ttyACM0`
   - If you see a different device name, note it down

6. Modify the Python script if needed:
   - Open the script in a text editor:

```bash

     nano water_sensor_monitor.py

 ```
     
   - Find the line `SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/ttyUSB0'`
   - Change it to match your port (likely `/dev/ttyACM0`)
   - Save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X)

7. Run the Python script:

```bash
      python3 water_sensor_monitor.py
 ```     

8. If you get permission errors:

```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
 ```
   
   Then log out and log back in, or try:
   
```bash
   sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0  # Or whatever your port is
 
 ```
   

The script should connect to your Arduino, read the water sensor data, and display a real-time visualization with matplotlib. All data will also be saved to a CSV file in the same directory.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during this process!
